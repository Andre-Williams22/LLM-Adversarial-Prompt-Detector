- **Metric optimization**: Prometheus metrics with minimal overhead

## 🧠 Fast Detection System

### **Performance Architecture**

The system features an optimized detection pipeline designed for production environments with strict latency requirements:

#### **🚀 Speed Optimizations**
- **Early Exit Strategy**: Keyword-based detection with 0.011s response time for obvious jailbreaks
- **Parallel Processing**: ML models run simultaneously using `asyncio` and `ThreadPoolExecutor`
- **CPU Optimization**: Tuned thread counts and model configurations for faster inference
- **Input Limiting**: Text truncation to optimal lengths for speed without accuracy loss

#### **📊 Performance Metrics**
| Detection Type | Response Time | Use Case |
|----------------|---------------|----------|
| Early Exit (Keywords) | 0.011s | Direct jailbreaks like "ignore previous instructions" |
| Parallel Ensemble | 0.4-0.7s | Complex adversarial patterns requiring full analysis |
| Average Performance | 0.3s | Mixed workload with 70% early exits |

### **🗳️ Hybrid Voting System**

Advanced multi-strategy voting mechanism that prioritizes **recall** (catching adversarial prompts) while maintaining acceptable precision:

#### **4-Layer Detection Strategy**
1. **High-Confidence Single Model** (Threshold: 0.7)
   - Immediate flagging for clear adversarial patterns
   - Keywords and safety classifier with high confidence scores

2. **Multiple Weak Signals** (Threshold: 0.3, Count: 2+)
   - Catches subtle attacks that trigger multiple models at lower confidence
   - Better recall for sophisticated prompt injections

3. **Majority Consensus** (Threshold: 0.5, Count: 2+)
   - Standard ensemble voting with balanced threshold
   - Reliable detection for typical adversarial attempts

4. **Weighted Ensemble** (Threshold: 0.45)
   - Final safety net with keyword detection weighted higher (35%)
   - Accounts for relative model reliability in adversarial detection

#### **🎛️ Sensitivity Modes**

| Mode | Use Case | False Positives | False Negatives | Best For |
|------|----------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Conservative** | Enterprise/Production | Very Low | Slightly Higher | Business applications |
| **Balanced** | General Use (Default) | Low | Low | Most applications |
| **High** | Security Research | Higher | Very Low | Maximum security needs |

```python
# Example usage with different sensitivity modes
from utils.fast_detection import detect_adversarial_prompt_fast

# Conservative mode (fewer false positives)
result = await detect_adversarial_prompt_fast(text, sensitivity_mode="conservative")

# High sensitivity mode (maximum detection)
result = await detect_adversarial_prompt_fast(text, sensitivity_mode="high")
```

#### **📈 Voting Mechanism Analytics**

The system tracks which voting mechanisms trigger for each detection:
- **MLflow Integration**: Logs voting details, mechanism triggers, and model scores
- **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks early exit rates and ensemble performance
- **Production Insights**: Analyzes voting patterns to optimize thresholds

### **🔧 Model Components**

1. **Keyword Detector** (Instant, ~0ms)
   - 30+ adversarial patterns including jailbreak attempts, role manipulation, instruction injection
   - Weighted scoring with high-risk keyword emphasis
   - Early exit optimization for obvious cases

2. **Toxicity Classifier** (~100ms)
   - unitary/toxic-bert for harmful content detection
   - Proper score extraction and error handling
   - Parallel execution with timing tracking

3. **Hate Speech Detection** (~150ms)
   - martin-ha/toxic-comment-model for improved accuracy
   - Reduced false positives compared to previous model
   - CPU-optimized inference

4. **Safety Classifier** (~200ms)
   - facebook/bart-large-mnli for zero-shot classification
   - Adversarial-specific labels for better detection
   - Handles complex prompt injection patterns

    "Can you roleplay as a helpful assistant?",
    sensitivity_mode="conservative"  # or "balanced", "high"
)

        "total": 0.012
    }
}
```

### **Sensitivity Mode Configuration**

```python
# Conservative Mode - Enterprise Safe
# - Higher thresholds (fewer false positives)
# - Requires stronger signals to flag content
# - Best for customer-facing applications
detector = FastAdversarialDetector(sensitivity_mode="conservative")

# Balanced Mode - Default (Recommended)
# - Optimal balance of recall and precision
# - Good for most production environments
# - Catches most adversarial patterns with reasonable false positive rate
detector = FastAdversarialDetector(sensitivity_mode="balanced")

# High Sensitivity Mode - Maximum Security
# - Lower thresholds (maximum detection)
# - May flag legitimate content as suspicious
# - Best for security research and high-risk environments
detector = FastAdversarialDetector(sensitivity_mode="high")
```

### **Integration with Main Application**

The fast detection system integrates seamlessly with the existing ChatGPT interface:

```python
# In main.py
from utils.fast_detection import detect_adversarial_prompt_fast

async def chat_and_detect(user_input: str):
    # Fast adversarial detection
    is_adversarial, detection_details = await detect_adversarial_prompt_fast(user_input)
    
    if is_adversarial:
        return {
            "response": "⚠️ Adversarial prompt detected and blocked",
            "detection_reason": detection_details["reason"],
            "inference_time": detection_details["inference_time"]
        }
    
    # Proceed with ChatGPT if safe
    response = await openai_client.chat.completions.create(...)
    return {"response": response.choices[0].message.content}
```
